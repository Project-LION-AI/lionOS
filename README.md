# lionOS: Open Source Notebooks for Discord People Analytics

This repository contains a series of notebooks for conducting language and communication analysis of organizational networks on discord with large language models. Built with OpenAI's [GPT-3](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) and the Huggingface `transformers` [library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).

## Getting started

We recommend running these notebooks on cloud platforms like [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or [Akash Network](https://akash.network/) for a decentralized option. Note that most notebooks require a GPU to run in a reasonable amount of time, so we recommend cloud platforms that come pre-installed with CUDA.

### Running on cloud

Run this the first cell of your notebook.

```
!git clone https://github.com/Project-LION-AI/lionOS.git
!pip install -r cfg/requirements.txt
```

## Data

Data is not currently provided for running these notebooks but our intention is to change that as soon as possible.
