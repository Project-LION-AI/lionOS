# lionOS: Open Source Notebooks for DAO People Analytics

This repository contains a series of notebooks for conducting language and communication analysis of organizational networks on discord with large language models. Built with OpenAI's [GPT-3](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) and the Huggingface `transformers` [library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).

## Getting started

We recommend running these notebooks on cloud platforms like [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or [Akash Network](https://akash.network/) for a decentralized option. Note that most notebooks require a GPU to run in a reasonable amount of time, so we recommend cloud platforms that come pre-installed with CUDA.

You can get started right away with our [classification notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Project-LION-AI/lionOS/blob/main/lion_classification_pipeline.ipynb?authuser=1#scrollTo=cb2b33a3-8377-48fc-aaac-beb71b989cd3) or [Akash Network](https://akash.network/) in Google Colab and produce this interactive topic network.

### Running on cloud

Run this the first cell of your notebook.

```
!git clone https://github.com/Project-LION-AI/lionOS.git
!pip install -r cfg/requirements.txt
```

## Data

Data is not currently provided for running these notebooks but our intention is to change that as soon as possible.
